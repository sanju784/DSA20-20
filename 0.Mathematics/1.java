1. If a number n is divisible by a, then there will exist a number b, such that b = n/a => a*b = n (here a & b) are called co-factors.
2. Among these co-factors one no. will always be less then sqrt(n) and another must be greater than sqrt(n), if no is perfect square then both may be equal.
3. So to check primary no. the best way is to run a loop from 2 to sqrt(n) => for (i=2;i<=sqrt(n);i++).
