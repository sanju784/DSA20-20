1. Time complexity defines the time taken by our program to execute multiple types of inputs. The behavior is mainly analyzed for larger input size. Using it we calculate the rate of growth of time as per the input size.

2. Asymptotic Notations are used for - Time Complexity Analysis
 - big-oh - Gives the Upper bound of the growth of rate of the function. It is much more used as using it we can say that our program running time will never go above this limit.
 - Omega - Lower bound of the growth of the function. 
 - Theta - It gives a tight bound of rate of growth of function.

3. Time complexity is analyzed for 
 a) Very large input size
 b) Worst case scenario - We generally calculate complexity for the worst case.
